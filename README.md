# Diabetes Prediction Bot

## Overview

The "Diabetes Prediction Bot" is a machine learning-based software application designed to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. Users can provide relevant medical and lifestyle data, and the bot analyzes this information to provide a predictive outcome. This tool is useful for early detection and risk assessment of diabetes, allowing individuals to take preventive measures and seek medical advice when necessary.

## Files

- `trained_model.sav`: This file contains the trained machine learning model for diabetes prediction.
- `Spyder multiple disease prediction(combo of heart & diabetes prediction bot).py`: This Python script can be used for deployment in the Spyder IDE.
- `diabetes.csv`: This data file contains the dataset used to train and test the diabetes prediction model.
- `diabetes_prediction.py`: This Python script is designed for use in Google Colab.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn).
2. Run the provided Python script (`Spyder multiple disease prediction(combo of heart & diabetes prediction bot).py`) in the Spyder IDE to deploy the bot.
3. Provide the required medical and lifestyle data as input.
4. The bot will analyze the data and provide a prediction regarding the likelihood of diabetes.
